To make the Parser.cs generated by gppg work with the project, do the following:

1)  Move the EToken enum to ../FLexer/ETokens.cs (or remove the newly created if not changed)
2)  Rename the "error" token to "ERROR", in the whole code
3)  Use namespace "FFC.FParser" for whole code
4)  Add "using FFC.FAST;" to "Parser.cs" 
5)  Add "using FFC.FLexer;" to "Parser.cs"
6)  Add "#define EXPORT_GPPG" to "Parser.cs"
7)  Check you also have "using QUT.Gppg;"
8)  Make class Parser "internal", and try the same for more "context visibility" conflicts
9)  Write Parser constructor, using base(), eg:
        protected Parser(Scanner scanner) : base(scanner){}

More to be yet discovered.
