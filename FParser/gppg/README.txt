To make the FParser.cs generated by gppg work with the project, do the following:

1) Move the toke enum to ../FLexer/ETokens.cs
2) Rename the "error" token to "ERROR"
3) Add namespace "FFC.FParser" to the whole code in "FParser.cs" 
4) Add "using "FFC.FLexer;" to "FParser.cs"
5) Add "#define EXPORT_GPPG" to "FParser.cs"

More to be yet discovered.
