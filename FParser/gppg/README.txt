To make the Parser.cs generated by gppg work with the project, do the following:

1) Move the EToken enum to ../FLexer/ETokens.cs (or remove the newly created if not changed)
2) Rename the "error" token to "ERROR"
3) Add "using FFC.FParser;" to "Parser.cs" 
4) Add "using FFC.FLexer;" to "Parser.cs"
5) Add "#define EXPORT_GPPG" to "Parser.cs"
6) Check you also have "using QUT.Gppg;"
7) Make classes with type visibility conflicts internal

More to be yet discovered.
