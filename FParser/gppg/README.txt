To make the Parser.cs generated by gppg work with the project, do the following:

1)  Move the EToken enum to ../FLexer/ETokens.cs (or remove the newly created if not changed)
2)  Rename the "error" token to "ERROR" in Initialize() @ line ~360
3)  Check ParserConstructor.cs for constructor declaration of Parser class

More to be yet discovered.
